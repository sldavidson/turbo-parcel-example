# Turborepo + Parcel Example

Created with `npx create-turbo@latest`.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager. It includes the two packages that use Parcel:

- `lib-1`: a stub React component library uses Parcel to build
- `lib-2`: another stub React component library uses Parcel to build

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```
